This is pMML2SVG tools to transform MathML into SVG inside XSL-FO and (X)HTML
code by using an XSLT 2.0 stylesheet.
It is distributed under the LGPL; see ../COPYING.


USAGE:   Edit and run otf2ttf to convert OpenType fonts to TrueType fonts.

	 Run fopmml2svg.xsl on a FO file to create a new FO file with
	 MathML replaced by embedded SVG.

	 Run htmlpmml2svg.xsl on an XHTML file to create a new XHTML
	 file with MathML replaced by external SVG files.

         For more detail about how to use these stylesheets, please
         refer to the user documentation in the ../doc/ directory.
