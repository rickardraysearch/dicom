This is TTFReader, the modified FOP tool to produce an XML metrics font file
from a TTF file. It has been modified to add bounding box of each glyph to the
XML metrics file.
It is distributed under the LGPL; see ../COPYING.


USAGE:   Before using the TTFReader, you have to build the source using a FOP
         distribution. For more detail about how to build and use this
         tool, please refer to the user documentation in the ../doc/ directory.
