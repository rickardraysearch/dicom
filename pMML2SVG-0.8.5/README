This is pMML2SVG, a transformation of Presentation MathML to SVG coded
in XSLT 2.0. It is distributed under the LGPL; see ./COPYING.


STATUS:  Beta. The MathML coverage is sufficient for many, if not most
	 use cases. The rendering quality is competitive with most
	 alternatives.

USAGE:   Transform your MathML code under XSLT2/pmml2svg.xsl using an
         XSLT 2.0 processor (to my knowledge, this currently means
         Saxon 9). The resulting document is valid SVG 1.1.  The root
         element possesses width and height attributes that tightly
         enclose the formula, and a viewBox is provided with origin at
         0 and a width and height identical to the attributes.

         See the script ./pmml2svg as an example (it will most likely
         require customization). Call it with one or more MathML
         filenames as arguments, and it creates corresponding .svg
         files. For example, run: ./pmml2svg examples/*.xml

         In ./examples/, run: ./genhtml
	 This creates a XHTML file that puts all examples into a single
         page, in MathML and SVG, for viewing with Mozilla or a
         browser equipped with appropriate plugins.

	 Alternatively, simply run: make

FONTS:   pMML2SVG requires a FOP-format XML font metrics file.  The
	 ttfreader/ subdirectory contains a tool that produces such a
	 file from a TrueType font.  For convenience, pMML2SVG ships
	 with ready-to-go font metrics files for the STIX fonts.
	 Moreover, tools/ contains otf2ttf, a script to convert
	 OpenType to TrueType fonts using FontForge.
