These instructions are for MacOS but should be generalizable to other platforms.

Pre-requisites:

	- you need to obtain and install "xsltproc" (e.g., "port install xsltproc")
	
	- you need to obtain and install "saxon" (e.g., "port install saxon") ... needed for pMML2SVG
	
	- for PDF, you need to have the right fonts in /Library/Fonts, specifically:
	
		Arial Unicode.ttf
		Arial Italic.ttf
		Arial Bold.ttf
		Arial Bold Italic.ttf
		AdobeSongStd-Light.otf
		KozMinPr6N-Regular.otf
		STIXGeneral.otf
		STIXGeneralItalic.otf
		STIXGeneralBol.otf
		STIXGeneralBolIta.otf
		STIXSizOneSymReg.otf
		STIXSizOneSymBol.otf
		
	- to enable DOCX generation you need to purchase the XMLmind XSL-FO Converter

You need to update the absolute paths in:

	catalogs/catalog.xml
	olinkdb_html.xml
	olinkdb_pdf.xml

by running:

	./updateabsolutepaths.sh
	
To enable PDF generation using a trial version of RenderX (XEP):

	mv XEP_trial XEP
	
To enable DOCX generation using a purchased version of XMLmind XSL-FO Converter called "xfc_pro_java-5_0_0":

	ln -s xfc_pro_java-5_0_0 xfc_pro_java
	
To make PDF and (X)HTML and chunked (X)HTML (and optionally DOCX) output run:

	./generateforrelease.sh

Note that the XEP/xep shell script and XEP/xep.xml config files have been patched (paths, fonts, etc.)

Note that the pMML2SVG/XSLT2/pmml2svg.xsl stylesheet has been patched (to use indent no rather than yes in output FO)

Note that the DOCX will be formatted with Arial as the sans-serif fonts, and that Asian text may or may
not be visible depending on your platform, and even if it is visible it will be low resolution; any Asian
text that is not visible can be made so by changing the font for the text to "Arial Unicode MS" after
installed ARIALUNI.TTF.
